This repository houses the documentation for metaflow, both for Python and R.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

# Making changes

All of the documentation is in the `docs` directory. Make your changes to the `.md` files in that directory.

If you want to see what your changes look like locally, follow the steps in `Viewing the documentation locally`

You can also preview your changes when you create a PR. There will be a link in the PR conversation tag under an **AWS Amplify** comment. This link is public and can be shared with your reviewers.
