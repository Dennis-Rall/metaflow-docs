# Metaflow Service Migration Guide

## Metaflow 2.1.+

In Metaflow 2.1.0, we introduced a new AWS service integration with AWS Step Functions. Now, users of Metaflow can easily deploy their flows to AWS Step Functions. If this is a functionality that you would like to use, depending on if/when you deployed the [metaflow service](../metaflow-on-aws.md#metadata), you might have to take some actions to upgrade your service.
